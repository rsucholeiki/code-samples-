# code-samples-
This github repository includes project samples, in R and Python, from coding exercises I have worked on. 
R coding projects include Kaplan-Meiyer survival analysis for a SOD1 mouse model study of ALS. 
Python coding exercizes include discrete difference and ODE model implementation and analysis, linear regressions, fourier transform analysis, and PCA function implementation and data analysis.
